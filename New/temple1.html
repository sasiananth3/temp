<p>The Statue of Wisdom, or the Valluvar Statue, is a 41-metre-tall (135 ft) stone sculpture of the Tamil poet and philosopher Valluvar, known as Thiruvalluvar, the author of the Thirukkural, an ancient Tamil work on morality. It is located atop a small island near the town of Kanniyakumari on the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula in the state Tamil Nadu, India, where two seas (the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea) and an ocean (the Indian Ocean) meet. The statue was sculpted by Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also created the Iraivan Temple, and was unveiled on the millennium day of 1 January 2000 by the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. It is currently the 25th tallest statue in India. During its silver jubilee celebrations on January 1, 2025, the Government of Tamil Nadu declared the statue as the “Statue of Wisdom”.</p>
